        <p>
            Thanks for taking the time to check out my website. If we weren't already introduced, my name is Harrison Bouche. I am a web developer and designer from the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. If you catch me outside of work, you'll likely find me singing, mountain biking, sipping coffee, or listening to podcasts somewhere in the rolling hills of Marquette.

            I am a senior at Northern Michigan University persuing two majors: Mobile and Web Application Development, Communication Studies, and, previously, Multimedia Production. All of the skills I have learned and taught myself are put to usein my business, <span class="font-bold">Sugar Maple Media</span>, where I provide digital development and design services with a focus on giving understandable consultation to small businesses and non-profits.
