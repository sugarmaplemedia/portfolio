## Overview

Top of the Lake Communities Association—often shortened to **Top of the Lake** and abbreviated as TOLCA— is a non-profit merchants association that provides community support for several towns in the midsection of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. I was connected with their team in May 2020 to design and develop a new website that would inspire more tourism and activity in the area.

The initial design, built by Kath who later contracted me for work with the [Finlandia Foundation website and digital backend](./finlandia-foundation), was functional but in need of a modern refresh. With the excellent [Kadence WP theme](https://www.kadencewp.com/) as my guide, I constructed a custom experience that incorporated design elements associated with both tourism and chamber of commerce websites.

As I built out the website, I also kept a Figjam sitemap to act as a log of progress.

## Website Development

For a Wordpress website needs to follow a template and be editable by a less-experienced editor, the design and development processes are closely intertwined. However, I needed to write some custom functionality into the site to meet the project objectives, such as:

-   Creating reusable components that may be implemented by an editor to maintain design cohesion
-   Customize existing components to properly meet the requirements of certain pages
-   Integrate calendar and form plugins to expand functionality
